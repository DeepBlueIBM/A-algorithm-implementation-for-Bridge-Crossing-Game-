# AI-Bridge-Crossing-Puzzle-
This is a part of the project I made for the Artificial Intelligence class alongside my team. The programm finds the best solution in a very sort time for the [Bridge Crossing Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_and_torch_problem) using the A star algorithm. You can read the README.txt file to see how it works and use it yourself.
